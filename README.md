### Performance
Load testing methodology:
- Test was run on MacBook Air M1 with 8GB RAM
- A test video `apps/loadtests/assets/test_to-gif.mp4` was created (1024x768, 10s)
- Using `k6`, a 60-second load test with 10 concurrent threads was executed
- After one minute, the number of converted GIF files stored in MinIO was counted
- In one minute, 5 workers converted **118 GIF files**

### Security Issue
There is one issue regarding the public access to the bucket.  
In theory, someone could brute-force file names and access other usersâ€™ uploads.  

I left it as is because I had already spent enough time on the project.  

*How I would fix it:*  
- Create anonymous registration for users  
- Store the owner of each file in the database  
- Serve files through a route that checks authorization
